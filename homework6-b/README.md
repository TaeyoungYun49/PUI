<b>Design Updates</b>
1. A low-fidelity prototype and design choices: The cart on the previous design takes up less than half of the page, but I changed it to the full pageview. I decided to change it in order to provide adequate information about the products with sufficient white space. 

2. A high-fidelity digital mockup and design choices:

Considering potential case that the list of products gets longer, I moved the total price section to the right, not below the product list. I also added a button to move the product to a wishlist to keep track of the product they are interested in. 

<b>Extra Credit</b>

1. The Wishtlist Functionality (max 3pts)
- Users can add items to their wishlist and access the wishlist page by clicking the heart icon next to the cart icon. 
- [Bonus] Users can move items in the wishlist to the cart and vice versa. 
- [Bonus] The wishlist icon on the Bed Pillow product page fills up when the item is added to the wishlist. 

2. Interesting JavaScript functionality (max 3pts)
- Included additional animation using javascript to provide playful interaction when users are adding items to wishlist.
- A text notification pops up when adding items to shopping cart.
- Shopping cart page correctly calculates the total price based on user’s selection (Pillow type and filler)

3. Carousel on ‘Bed Pillow Detail Page’ shows similar products (max 5pts) 
The carousel can be manually operated using arrow icons on the side, but automatically scrolls to the right as well. 

4. All the product pages are functional and can be added to shopping cart with the option kept. (max 2pts)
