1. HTML+CSS of a shopping cart
2. Add some JS to the Product Detail page to support different customization options
3. Add some JS to show feedback for items being added to the shopping cart

<b>Bonus</b>
1. Created a button for scrolling back to the top of the page using javascript (index.html)
2. All the feedback from all the product pages reflected in the shopping cart

<b>Design Updates</b>
1. A low-fidelity prototype and design choices: The cart on the previous design takes up less than half of the page, but I changed it to the full pageview. I decided to change it in order to provide adequate information about the products with sufficient white space. 

2. A high-fidelity digital mockup and design choices:

Considering potential case that the list of products gets longer, I moved the total price section to the right, not below the product list. I also added a button to move the product to a wishlist to keep track of the product they are interested in.
